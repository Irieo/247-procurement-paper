\section{Introduction}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \centering
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Climate change is driving a global effort to rapidly decarbonise 
    electricity systems across the globe. 
    Many public and private energy buyers have joined this effort 
    by purchasing certificates for renewable energy or
    by procuring renewable energy directly with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
    \item Such \alert{voluntary commitments accelerate the deployment of renewable 
    capacity} above the policy requirements in the countries and jurisdictions
    where these companies operate, facilitating faster
    transformation of electricity markets.
    \item Additionally, many early actors in the field have paved the way for others to follow 
    \hrefc{https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf}{by 
    developing methods and establishing standard contracts} for clean energy procurement.
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{6cm}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item   PPAs typically are typically used for renewable energy to match generation 
        and consumption on average over a year.
        \item For example, more than 370 members of the \href{https://www.there100.org/}{RE100} group have committed to purchasing enough renewable energy to match
        \alert{100\% of their electricity consumption on an annual basis}.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item However, electricity buyers that commit to 100\% annual matching 
    from renewable energy sources still face times when generation 
    from wind and solar generators is not sufficient to match 
    the companiesâ€™ electricity demand. 
    \item Thus, although buyers match their demand on a \alert{yearly} basis with 
    renewable energy, on an \alert{hourly} basis they still have hours 
    when they have to rely on carbon-emitting technologies available 
    on the local market, such as coal and gas-fired power plants.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  
  More generally, 100\% annual matching leads to many challenges 
  from the electricity buyers' and system perspectives: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No \alert{simultaneity} - variable generation of wind and solar power is not aligned with the 
  buyers' electricity consumption profile.
  \item Lack of \alert{additionality} - some buyers procure unbundled guarantees of origin from existing 
  facilities, which does not lead to additional renewable generation.
  \item Displaced \alert{location} - some buyers procure PPAs from locations far away 
  from their consumption, where there is no way to transmit the electricity to the demand.
  \item Exposure to \alert{risk} - electricity buyers are exposed to price volatility 
  in local electricity markets, since they still have to procure electricity to cover
  the difference between demand and supply.
  \item Need for \alert{backup} - the rest of the electricity system still has to 
  maintain backup and flexibility options for hours with low renewable generation.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{24/7 carbon-free energy}

  \centering

  There is growing interest from leaders in voluntary clean
  electricity procurement to cover their consumption 
  with clean energy supply on a \alert{truly 24/7 basis}. \\
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met
  with carbon-free electricity sources, \alert{every hour of every day}.
  
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Yearly versus hourly matching}
  
  24/7 CFE procurement has potential benefits over the 100\% renewable matching:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure match of electricity consumption with carbon-free resources 
        on an \alert{hourly basis}.
  \item Enable much \alert{deeper reductions in CO$_2$ emissions} associated 
        to buyer's electricity consumption.
  \item Ensure that contracted power is \alert{additional} (i.e. leads to new capacity).
  \item Ensure that power comes from the \alert{same bidding zone}.
  \item Enable technology-neutral procurement of \alert{carbon-free} rather than renewable technologies 
        (such as advanced clean dispatchable power generation and long-duration energy storage).
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Focus of the study}

  In this study, we investigate both the \alert{means and costs of 24/7 procurement} 
  for companies in a selection of European countries 
  and the \alert{system impacts} for the rest of the European electricity system. 
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  In particular, we focus our analysis on the following quesitons:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item How can companies following 24/7~CFE procurement achieve hourly matching?
    \item What is the cost premium of 24/7~CFE versus 100\% annual matching?
    \item To what extent can technologies, such as long-duration storage or advanced dispatchable
          clean generators, help to achieve the 24/7~CFE goal?
    \item To which extent can 24/7~CFE contribute to reductions in CO$_2$
          emissions intensity of buyers' consumption? 
    \item If many companies follow the 24/7~CFE approach, how does this affect 
    emissions and flexibility needs in the rest of the electricity system?
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Summary of key findings}

  \centering
  {\small

  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
    \begin{enumerate}

    \item 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to lower emissions for both the buyer and the system,
      as well as reducing the needs for flexibility in the rest of the system.  

    \item Reaching CFE for 90-95\% of the time can be done with only a small cost premium compared to annually matching 
    100\% renewable energy. 90-95\% CFE can be met by supplementing wind and solar with battery storage.

    \item Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
    and storage technologies, with costs increasing rapidly above 95\%.
    
    \item 100\% CFE target could have a much smaller cost premium if long duration storage or 
    clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
    
    \item 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
    stimulating innovation and learning from which the whole electricity system would benefit.

\section{Methodology and study design}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A quick overview}


{\small
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The mathematical model for this study is build upon 
    \hrefc{https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur}{PyPSA-Eur(-Sec)} --
    a widely-used open-source optimization model for the European energy system.

    \item We encode a set of new equations and routines into the PyPSA-Eur(-Sec),
    which allow for modelling a situation when some corporate \& industrial (C\&I) electricity consumers 
    commit to a voluntary clean energy procurement.

    \item We compare 100\% annual matching with renewable energy versus 
    different targets for hourly CFE matching.

    \item We place C\&I consumers committed to a clean energy procurement in a 
    selection of European countries: Germany, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.
    These countries differ in patterns of electricity demand, renewable potentials,
    national energy and climate policies, legacy fleets of generation capacities, degree 
    of interconnectons, etc. Apart form that, we consider different C\&I participation rates, a wide palette 
    of CFE generation technologies available for 24/7 consumers, 
    and two years (2025 and 2030). These differences help to understand and generalize 
    the impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement.

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 100\% annual matching}

  {\small
  
The \alert{100\% annual matching} is modelled with a constraint (\ref{eqn:RES100}), which requires C\&I consumers 
to purchase enough renewable electricity from the local bidding zone to match all of their electricity consumption
on an annual basis.

\vspace{0.3cm}
More formally, the sum of all dispatch $g_{r,t}$ for RES generators $r\in RES$ over the year $t\in T$ 
is equal to the annual demand $d_t$ of C\&I consumers:
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{r\in RES, t\in T} g_{r,t} = \sum_{t\in T} d_t
  \label{eqn:RES100}
  \end{equation}

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 24/7 CFE matching}

  {\small

  The \alert{24/7 CFE matching} is modelled with a constraint (\ref{eqn:CFE}), 
  which matches demand of C\&I consumers with carbon-free resources on an hourly basis. 

  More formally, the constraint states that sum over generators from procured CFE resources $r\in CFE$,
  discharge and charge from storage technologies $s\in STO$,
  as well as import from the grid $im_t$ multiplied by the grid's CFE factor $CFE_t$
  must be higher or equal than a certain CFE target $x$ multiplied with the total load:
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{r\in CFE, t\in T} g_{r,t} + \sum_{s\in STO, t\in T} \left(\bar{g}_{s,t} - \ubar{g}_{s,t}\right) - \sum_{t\in T} ex_t + \sum_{t\in T} CFE_t \cdot im_t \geq x \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t

  \noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  Note that the grid CFE factor $CFE_t$ is affected by capacity procured by C\&I consumers. This
  introduces a nonconvex term to the optimization problem. The nonconvexity can be avoided by treating 
  the grid CFE factor as a parameter that is iteratively updated (starting with $CFE_t =0 \,~\forall t$). 
  Similarly to the \hrefc{https://acee.princeton.edu/24-7/}{Xu et al. (2021)} study, 
  we find that one forward pass (i.e. 2 iterations) yields very good convergence.

\begin{frame}{Implementation of 24/7 CFE matching}

  {\small

  The excess generation $ex_t$ from the procured resources represents clean electricity sold to the rest of the grid. 
  The \alert{excess is not counted toward the CFE score} -- 
  and thus it is subtracted on the left-hand side of the eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}).

  CFE generation above the demand can be stored and shifted to another hour where procured resources 
  generate less than the C\&I demand, sold to the regional grid as excess $ex_t$
  at {\bf market prices}, or curtailed. 
  The total amount of excess generation is constrained to a certain level on an annual basis. 
  In this study, the limit is set to 20\% of annual 24/7 participating customer's demand:
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{t\in T} ex_t \leq ExLimit \cdot \sum_{t\in T} d_t
  \label{eqn:excess}
  \end{equation}

  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  The constraint (\ref{eqn:excess}) gives the C\&I consumers the flexibility to sell 
  electricity to the regional grid, while avoiding the situation that sales to the grid 
  become significantly larger than supply to the C\&I's own demand.

  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%

  electricity price indicator in a competitive market.

\begin{frame}{CFE factor of the regional grid}

  {\small

  The \alert{grid CFE factor} $CFE_t$ in eq. (\ref{eqn:CFE}) defines the share of 
  carbon-free electricity  in grid imports by C\&I consumers following 24/7 approach. 
  The factor depends on the generation mix in the region where C\&I consumers are located, 
  as well as on the generation mix in other regions from which electricity is imported
  to the local region ($import_t$). 

  \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{8cm}

  Using the notation on the right, the average cleanness 
  of the rest of the electricity system is:
  \begin{equation*}
  ImportCFE_t = \frac{A_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  The CFE factor of grid supply\footnote{Note 
  that generators contracted by 24/7 consumers (C) are excluded from the grid supply.} 
  for a given hour $t$ is:
  
  \begin{equation*}
  CFE_t = \frac{B_t + ImportCFE_t * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}
  \end{equation*}

\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 1/2}

  {\small

  \alert{CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the dispatch of emitting power plants 
  in the European electricity system are part of the model solution.
  We can use this information to calculate (i) the \emph{emissionality} of generation 
  that serves participating 24/7 demand, and (ii) the \emph{avoided emissions}, i.e.,
  the difference in regional CO$_2$ emissions with and without 24/7 procurement. 
  Similarly to the logic of computing the grid CFE factor, 
  we need to consider imported emissions also in this calculation.
  
  First, let $X(D)_t$ be hourly emissions $[tCO_2]$ in the rest of the electricity system. 
  The average emissions rate of the rest of the system is calculated as:

  \begin{equation*}
  SystemEmisRate = \frac{X(D)_t}{A_t + D_t}
  \end{equation*}

  Second, let $Y(E)_t$ be hourly emissions in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located.
  The emissions rate of grid supply is then:

  \begin{equation*}
  GridSupplyEmisRate = \frac{Y(E)_t + SystemEmisRate * import_t}{B_t + E_t + import_t}
  \end{equation*}

  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{CO$_2$ emissions rate of the regional grid and 24/7 portfolio, 2/2}

  {\small
  Third, we calculate {CO$_2$ emissions} associated with the electricity consumption of 
  24/7 participating consumers on an hourly basis:
  
  \begin{equation*}
  Emissions_t = GridSupply_t * GridSupplyEmisRate_t
  \end{equation*}

  Now, we have the necessary components to calculate two metrics of interest for our analysis. 
  A first metric is the \alert{average emissions rate of 24/7 consumers}:

  \begin{equation*}
    (C\&I)EmisRate = \frac{\sum_{t\in T} Emissions_t}{\sum_{t\in T} Load_t}
  \end{equation*}

  A second metric is the \alert{avoided emissions} by 24/7 procurement. The calculation is based on the 
  difference between the total {CO$_2$ emissions} in the regional grid where 24/7 consumers are located
  with and without 24/7 procurement (\emph{'247-cfe'} and \emph{'reference'} labels, accordingly):

  \begin{equation*}
    AvoidedEmissions = \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{reference} - \sum_{t\in T} Y(E)_t^{247-cfe}
  \end{equation*}

  (iii) \alert{A reference case} when 24/7 consumers cover their load purely with grid purchases 
  without any policy regarding the origin of electricity.

\section{Modelling results and analysis}

\begin{frame}{Scenario space}

  {\small
  The following section presents modelling results and related analysis. 
  For convenience, we start with a \alert{base scenario} 
  with the following setup:

    \quad{\bf Zone:} IE | DE | DK1 | NL \\
    \quad{\bf Technology palette:} 1 | 2 | 3 \\
    \quad{\bf Year:} 2025 \\ 
    \quad{\bf Participation rate:} 10\% of C\&I demand in a modelled zone \\
    \quad{\bf Demand profile}: baseload (flat) \\
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Afterwards, we explore the scenario space further by implementing one-at-a-time 
  adjustments to the base scenario: \\
  (i) implementing year {\bf 2030}, \\
  (ii) implementing participation rate of {\bf 25\%}, \\ 
  (iii) implementing {\bf other types of demand profiles} for C\&I consumers.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  For interested parties, we publish an \hrefc{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7180098}{online annex} 
  with a full pack of modelling results alongside this study. The annex 
  includes modelling results for all scenario combinations.

A plot on the left shows the {\bf fraction of hourly demand met with carbon-free

\vspace{0.3cm}
In the reference case, where C\&I consumers do not procure any resources,  
relying purely on grid purchases, \alert{only 61\%} of demand is met with CFE.

\vspace{0.3cm}
100\% RES -- the best case for the annual renewable matching policy -- 
results in 85\% fraction. Thus, \alert{CFE targets beyond 85\%} yield 
higher share of hourly demand met with CFE
than 100\% RES procurement policy.

\vspace{0.3cm}
When CFE target approaches 100\%, C\&I participants 
\alert{rely more on procured resources}.

\vspace{0.1cm}
Next, we investigate how the choice of a procurement policy affects the {\bf average emissions 
rate} of 24/7 participating C\&I consumers.

\vspace{0.3cm}
Already in 2025, Ireland has a moderately clean electricity system: 
the C\&I emission rate in the reference case is at 138~kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
100\% annual matching with renewable energy reduces the 
C\&I emission rate to 53 kg/MWh.

\vspace{0.3cm}
When actively matching the carbon-free electricity and the load with 
24/7 procurement, C\&I participants can achieve \alert{lower emission 
rates than with the 100\% RES policy} with CFE targets beyond 85\%. 
As CFE target is tightened further, average emissions \alert{drop to zero}.

  If we now turn to the {\bf portfolio capacity} procured by 
  C\&I consumers, we see that at this level of participation
  (10\% of C\&I load in Ireland is at 220~MW), the 100\% RES policy can be 
  me by procuring near to 1.5~GW of onshore wind and solar generators.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  In this scenario, hourly matching renewable generation and the 24/7 participating load
  requires a \alert{much bigger portfolio} of renewable generators than the 
  100\% RES policy. 

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Also, above 85\% 24/7 procurement sees \alert{battery storage} enter the portfolio  mix.
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Note that for 80\% CFE, 24/7 participating C\&I consumers procure less 
  capacity than for 100\% RES policy, as it relies more on grid imports.

    Note that revenues from selling the excess electricity to the regional grid

    subtracted from the net procurement cost.

    \vspace{0.3cm}
    A CFE target of 90-95\% can be achieved at a small cost premium to 100\% 
    annual renewable matching with solar, wind and batteries. However,
    what stands out in the plot is the rapid increase of procurement costs  
    for high CFE targets. For example, 98\% CFE target has 
    cost premium of only 55\% over 100\% annual renewable matching; while
    \alert{the last 2\% of hourly CFE matching more than doubles the 
    cost}.

    If we look at the results for the technological {\bf Palette 2} -- 
    when C\&I consumers have an access to the long-duration energy storage (LDES) --
    we see a different picture. The portfolio of renewable capacity 
    C\&I consumers for the 100\% CFE target is not much larger 
    than for 100\% RES (see the left panel). The LDES system helps to align the load 
    with the generation of procured variable renewable resources. 
    In the right panel, we can see that a LDES system (here 2.5~â‚¬/kWh 
    hydrogen storage in caverns) can \alert{significantly limit the procurement cost
    increase} at high CFE targets. In this scenario, 
    100\% CFE costs only 50\% more than a 100\% RES policy.

  can create a market for and benefit from the advanced technologies such as

  In the case of Ireland, NG Allam Cycle generator is added to the

  rest of the electricity system. The plot on the left shows
  {\bf CO$_2$~emissions in the local region} of 24/7 participating 
  consumers -- Ireland.
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  Without any procurement, the model estimates 
  Irish power sector carbon emissions to be at the level of 3.5~MtCO$_2$
  (for comparison, 
  \hrefc{https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-statistics/co2/}{seai.ie}
  reports this value to be at 8.4~MtCO$_2$ in 2020, with a strong decreasing trend).

  \vspace{0.1cm}
  100\% annual renewable matching can deliver greater system-level CO$_2$ emissions
  reductions than lower CFE scores. 100\% RES reduces emissions in Ireland by 
  ca. 0.6~MtCO$_2$ per year (at 10\% participation rate).
  
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  However, beyond 85\% CFE targets, 24/7 hourly matching achieves
  \alert{greater emissions reductions} than 100\% RES.

  In comparison to the case of Ireland, the German grid is cleaner in 2025, 
  in particular due to good interconnections with e.g., France and Denmark. 
  Thus, without procuring any resources, C\&I consumers reach
  a 79\% share of demand met with CFE.

  The cleaner grid results in a higher fraction (ca. 92\% CFE)
  achieved with the 100\% annual renewable matching policy. 
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Similar to the Irish results, C\&I participants rely more on procured 
  resources with tighter CFE targets.

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Note that for lower CFE targets, constraint (\ref{eqn:CFE}) 
  is not binding, what makes the same cost-optimal shares of

The plot on the left shows {\bf the fraction of hourly demand met with CFE}

The first observation is that in the reference case,
74\% of demand is met with CFE, which is 13\% more than in 2025. 
Furthermore, there are \alert{two findings} 
on the hourly 24/7 matching: \\

\vspace{0.1cm}
{\bf First}, lower CFE targets (such as 80\%) can be met without 
any procurement of renewable generators by C\&I consumers. Instead,
the target is reached by a combination of grid imports and battery
storage (see next slide). \\

\vspace{0.1cm}
{\bf Second}, grid imports can still play a role in reaching 100\% CFE,
as LDES and advanced dispatchable technologies offer flexibility
in matching renewable generation with C\&I load on hourly basis, while 
grid imports are possible during the hours when regional grid is clean.

The {\bf average emissions rate} of 24/7 participating C\&I consumers
is intuitively lower with a cleaner regional network -- 
the reference case value is reduced from 138~kg/MWh in 2025 to 
89~kg/MWh in 2030.

\vspace{0.3cm}
Nevertheless, the dynamics of 24/7 CFE vs 100\% RES 
procurement remains the same also in 2030: an hourly 24/7 matching 
allows for net-zero emissions associated with the C\&I buyers' consumption,
with a lower emission rate already above ca. 85\% CFE (in this scenario).

\vspace{0.3cm}
Another interesting result is that a CFE target of 90\% yields 
\alert{lower C\&I emission rate} than 100\% RES policy, although it 
\alert{costs less} (by ca. 2.5~\euro/MWh, see the C\&I cost plot above).

  Finally, we explore two more sensitivity scenarios. \\
  In particular, we are interested in the following questions: \\

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  {\small
  (i) How do the findings change with higher participation rates of C\&I consumers? 
  For this analysis, we assume that {\bf 25\%} of C\&I consumers in a selected region 
  joins voluntary clean energy procurement. \\
  \alert{Finding:} Higher participation rates result in a similar mix of procured resources 
  (for a given zone, year and palette of technologies) and associated costs for C\&I participants, 
  while facilitating a much greater impact on the rest of the system.}
  }}

  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{%
  {\small
  (ii) To what extent do consumption profiles of C\&I participants drive the results? Here we model 
  {\bf two synthetic hourly demand profiles} representing 'datacenter' 
  and 'industry consumer' and benchmark the two with the reference baseload (flat) profile. \\
  \alert{Finding:} The shape of consumption profiles of C\&I participants affect the cost-optimal technology
  mix in a procured portfolio; however, the impacts on the procurement cost, emissionality of the portfolio,
  as well as the system impacts of 24/7 procurement are negligible.

\section{Conclusions and project outlook}

{\small
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 1:} 24/7~carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement leads to 
     \alert{lower emissions for both the buyer and the system},
     as well as reducing the needs for flexibility in the rest of the system.  
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 2:} Reaching CFE for 90-95\% of the time can be done with only a \alert{small cost premium}
      compared to annually matching 100\% renewable energy. 
      90-95\% CFE can be met by supplementing wind and solar with battery storage.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 3:} Reaching 100\% CFE target is possible but costly with existing renewable 
     and storage technologies, with \alert{costs increasing rapidly above 95\%}.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 4:} 100\% CFE target could have a \alert{much smaller cost premium} if long duration storage or 
      clean dispatchable technologies like advanced geothermal are available.
   }}

   \noindent\fbox{%
   \parbox{\textwidth}{%
     {\bf Conclusion 5:} 24/7~CFE procurement would create an early market for the advanced technologies,
     stimulating innovation and learning from which the \alert{whole electricity system would benefit}.
    }}

\begin{frame}{Project outlook}

  This project will continue analysing the impact of 24/7 procurement in Europe until March 2024. \\
  We will deepen the analysis by examining the following:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The impacts of \alert{temporal demand-side management} at datacenters;
      \item The impact of \alert{spatial demand-shifting between datacenters} at different locations, 
      so that compute jobs can move where the clean energy is available;
      %We will explore the potential benefits for both the buyers and the system 
      %in terms of reduced 24/7 procurement costs and system emissions.
      \item The impacts of \alert{parametric uncertainties} and corresponding assumptions when constructing the model of 
      the European energy system. These include: \\
      \quad (i) Scenarios for carbon price developments in the EU ETS; \\
      \quad (ii) Scenarios for inter-connector capacities based on the TYNDP or free optimization; \\
      \quad (iii) Scenarios for expansion of electric vehicles, heat pumps, industry electrification; \\
      \quad (iv) Prices for primary energy carriers; \\ 
      \quad (v) Weather year realizations. 
      \item In addition, the modelling will use a \alert{higher-resolution grid} model,
       so that transmission network impacts can be estimated.
    \end{itemize}
