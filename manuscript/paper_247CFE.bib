  abstract = {Current greenhouse gas accounting standards allow companies to use renewable energy certificates (RECs) to report reductions in emissions from purchased electricity (scope 2) as progress towards meeting their science-based targets. However, previous analyses suggest that corporate REC purchases are unlikely to lead to additional renewable energy production. Here we show that the widespread use of RECs by companies with science-based targets has led to an inflated estimate of the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. When removing the emission reductions claimed through RECs, companies' combined 2015\textendash 2019 scope 2 emission trajectories are no longer aligned with the 1.5\,\textdegree C goal, and only barely with the well below 2\,\textdegree C goal of the Paris Agreement. If this trend continues, 42\% of committed scope 2 emission reductions will not result in real-world mitigation. Our findings suggest a need to revise accounting guidelines to require companies to report only real emission reductions as progress towards meeting their science-based targets.},

PyPSA includes models for conventional generators with unit commitment, variable renewable generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. It is designed to be easily extensible and to scale well with large networks and long time series. In this paper the basic functionality of PyPSA is described, including the formulation of the full power flow equations and the multi-period optimisation of operation and investment with linear power flow equations. PyPSA is positioned in the existing free software landscape as a bridge between traditional power flow analysis tools for steady-state analysis and full multi-period energy system models. The functionality is demonstrated on two open datasets of the transmission system in Germany (based on SciGRID) and Europe (based on GridKit).~Funding statement: This research was conducted as part of the CoNDyNet project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under grant no. 03SF0472C.

  abstract = {In the United States, electricity consumers are told that they can ``buy'' electricity from renewable energy projects, versus fossil fuel-fired facilities, through participation in voluntary green power markets. The marketing messages communicate to consumers that they are causing additional renewable energy generation and reducing emissions through their participation and premium payments for a green label. Using a spatial financial model and a database of registered Green-e wind power facilities, the analysis in this paper shows that the voluntary Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) market has a negligible influence on the economic feasibility of these facilities. Nevertheless, voluntary green power marketers at least implicitly claim that buying their products creates additional renewable energy. This study indicates the contrary. Participants in U.S. voluntary green power markets associated with wind power, therefore, appear to be receiving misleading marketing messages regarding the effect of their participation. In the process of completing this analysis, a potentially relevant factor in explaining investor behavior was identified: the potential for the overlap of voluntary REC markets with compliance REC markets that supply utilities need to meet their obligations of Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS). The majority of state RPS rules allow for regional or even national sourcing of RECs, meaning that projects are generally eligible to provide compliance RECs to utilities not only in their home states, but in several other states.},

The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets to one another.},

  abstract = {This study represents the first analysis of the electricity system-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free energy procurement (24/7 CFE). We use a detailed open-source electricity system optimization model, GenX, which plans investment and operational decisions to meet projected future electricity demand while meeting all relevant engineering, reliability, and policy constraints at lowest cost. In this study, we implement a set of new constraints to model the impact of a share of corporate and industrial (C\&I) electricity consumers participating in voluntary 24/7 CFE procurement, where a portfolio of carbon-free generation from within the same grid region is used to meet hourly electricity demand profiles of participating C\&I consumers. We model impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement in two regional power systems: California and the PJM Interconnection. These two systems differ in patterns of electricity demand, weather, renewable resource quality, state policy, and existing generation capacity and help generalize the impacts of 24/7 CFE procurement. For comparison, we also model reference cases with no voluntary procurement and cases where the equivalent share of C\&I consumers meet 100\% of annual energy demand on a volumetric basis with renewable energy procurement (100\% annual matching). This case assumes procured renewable energy is from within the same model region and is 100\% additional to state RPS requirements. We find: 24/7 carbon-free electricity (CFE) procurement:~ Can eliminate carbon dioxide emissions associated with a buyer's electricity consumption, going beyond the impact of procurement of renewable energy to meet 100\% of annual volumetric demand. Can drive greater system-level emissions reductions than 100\% annual matching if the CFE target is high enough. Drives early deployment of advanced, `clean firm' generation and/or long-duration energy storage, creating initial markets for deployment, innovation, and cost-reductions that make it easier for societal at large to follow the path to 100\% carbon-free electricity. Better matches participating demand during periods of limited supply and thus drives significantly more retirement of natural gas generating capacity than 100\% annual matching. Comes at a more significant cost premium relative to 100\% annual matching; this premium is significantly reduced if a full portfolio of clean firm resources is available and procured and/or CFE targets below 100\% are selected.},

For comparison, we also model scenarios where the same participants procure CFE to meet 100\% of electricity demand on an annual volumetric basis, a common practice today we refer to as volumetric matching. Results show that the attributional carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 24/7 CFE participants employing hourly matching is significantly lower than 100\% volumetric matching due to better alignment between participants' electricity consumption and CFE generation. Given a high CFE target, hourly CFE procurement can also drive greater system-level CO2 emissions reductions. Hourly 24/7 CFE procurement drives early deployment of advanced, 'clean firm' resources, such as natural gas power plants with carbon capture and storage and long-duration energy storage. While hourly matching delivers greater impact, it also comes at a more significant cost premium (\$13/MWh - \$30/MWh higher) than volumetric matching. This cost premium is lower when a full portfolio of clean firm resources is available and can be further reduced by targeting less than 100\% hourly matching.},
