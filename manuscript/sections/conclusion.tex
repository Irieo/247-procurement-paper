In this work, we systematically examined the means, costs, and the system-level impacts of the 24/7 carbon-free energy matching.
We find that 24/7 matching is a viable and effective strategy for electricity buyers aiming to eliminate their own carbon footprint and contribute to wider system decarbonisation.
Voluntary commitments to the hourly matching strategy have a further transformative effect on electricity systems through accelerated innovation and early deployment of advanced energy technologies.
The evidence holds across geographical locations and is robust to sensitivity analyses.
Even as grids become cleaner over time, the 24/7 matching strategy retains its significance in reducing system-level emissions, which is essential in light of evolving national energy and climate policies.
