In this section, we present modelling results and related analysis. 
In the analysis, we explore how the 247-CFE and the 100\% annual renewable matching procurement approaches affect both the participating electricity buyers and the electricity system as a whole. 
Focusing on the electricity buyers' perspective, we analyse procurement strategies (i.e. the optimal mix of locally procured capacities of energy generation \& storage assets and electricity imports from the grid), the average costs of procured electricity and carbon emissions associated with the consumers' electricity usage.
When our focus switches to the system perspective, we describe the impact of the \gls{cfe} procurement approaches on \co emissions on the local grids, as well as the impact on back up flexibility needs.

As described in \cref{subsec:scenarios}, we aim to generalize our findings void individual assumptions by incorporating a large scenario space into the study design. 
For convenience, we start with a \textit{base scenario} presented in \cref{subsec:base}.
Afterwards, we explore the scenario space further by presenting selected results that answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item What if clean electricity buyers have an access to a wider palette of carbon-free technologies that are expected to be available for a commercial scale up in the near future (\cref{subsec:palette})?
\item What if electricity buyers are located in parts of the European electricity grid that are much different to the base scenario? (\cref{subsec:location})?
\item What if electricity procurement takes place in 2030 instead of 2025 (\cref{subsec:time})? 
\item Finally, in \cref{subsec:mechanisms}, we explore how exactly 24/7 CFE commitments help to decarbonize local grids and reveal the individual mechanisms behind this effect that are present across the scenario space.
\end{enumerate}

In the Annex \ref{sec:si}, we summarise findings from sensitivity analyses regarding higher 24/7 procurement participations rates and various consumption profiles of electricity buyers.

Given the large scenario space, the manuscript presents results for selected scenario branches that generalise system impacts of 24/7 hourly clean electricity procurement.
For interested reader, we provide results for the entire scenario space in a dashboard that is published online alongside this study, see \nameref{sec:code}.

\subsection{Base scenario}
\label{subsec:base}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{res}
    24/7 carbon-free electricity (CFE) procurement can eliminate carbon emissiosns of a buyer's electricity consumption and helps to decarbonise the whole electricity system.
\end{res}

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{res}
    90\%--95\% 24/7 CFE targets have only a small cost premium over 100\% annual renewable matching. 100\% 24/7 CFE can be achieved with solar, wind and battery storage, but at a high cost premium.
\end{res}


The base scenario reflects a case when \textbf{10\%} (on volumetric basis) of commertial \& industrial consumers in \textbf{Ireland} in \textbf{2025} voluntrary commits to 24/7 clean electricity procurement goal.
This assumption yields 220~MW of \textbf{base load} that has to be matched with clean electricity. 
The participating consumers can achieve the \gls{cfe} procurement goal by co-optimizing local procurement with the \textbf{palette 1} of technologies (i.e., mature technologies available on the market now: onshore wind, solar, and battery storage), as well as by importing electrcity from the local grid.

\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-used} shows the fraction of the fraction of hourly demand met with carbon-free electricity depending on the procurement policy that \gls{ci} consumers follow.
We contrast two main cases, one where participating consumers commit to 100\% annual renewable matching policy (100\% RES) and another case where the consumers commit to 24/7 hourly matching policy with various \gls{cfe} scores in a range from 80\% to 100\%. 
A \textit{reference case} depicts a case when the consumers cover their load purely with grid purchases without any policy regarding the origin of electricity.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plots/10/2025/IE/p1/used.pdf}
    \caption{Fraction of hourly demand met with carbon-free electricity.}
    \label{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-used}
\end{figure}

In the reference case, where \gls{ci} consumers do not procure any resources, relying purely on grid purchases, only 54\% of demand is met with clean electricity.
100\% RES -- the best case for the annual renewable matching policy -- results in 83\% fraction. 
Consequently, 24/7~CFE targets beyond 85\% yield higher share of hourly demand met with clean electricity than 100\% annual matching policy.

Another notable trend in \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-used} is that \gls{ci} participants rely more on procured resources and less on grid imports with higher CFE target.
When CFE target approaches 100\%, \gls{ci} consumers cannot rely on electricity imports from the grid, since the grid supply mix contains some carbon content in almost all hours.

\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-ci_emisrate} shows how choice of a procurement policy affects the average emissions rate of \gls{ci} consumers.
Already in 2025, Ireland has a moderately clean electricity system: the emission rate is at 177~g\co/kWh in the reference case. 
If \gls{ci} consumers follow 100\% RES goal and procure enough renewable recourses, the emission rate is reduced to 60~g\co/kWh.
This yields a considerable emission rate reduction compared to the reference case.
The 24/7 procurement policy with CFE targets above 85\% can help the participating consumers to reduce emissions further, or eliminate them competely in the case of 100\% 24/7~CFE.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plots/10/2025/IE/p1/ci_emisrate.pdf}
    \caption{Average emissions rate of participating consumers.}
    \label{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-ci_emisrate}
\end{figure}

Voluntary procurement of clean electricity also helps decarbonise electricity system as a whole.
We explore this effect by plotting \co emissions in the local region of the participating consumers, i.e. Ireland.
Without voluntary procurement, the model estimates Irish power sector carbon emissions to be at the level of 4.2~Mt\co -- see a reference case in \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-zone_emissions}.
\footnote{For comparison, \href{https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-publications/co2-emissions-report/}{seai.ie} reports this value to be at 10.3~Mt\co in 2021.
A strong decreasing trend is expected, since Irish government has set ambitious targets to achieve a low-carbon energy system \cite{SEAI}.}
The modelling results show that if only 10\% of \gls{ci} electricity demand commits to 100\% 24/7 carbon-free electricity in 2025, it would reduce Irish emissions by 0.6~Mt\co per year compared to the scenario with no voluntary procurement.
This reduction is equivalent to 14\% of Irish power sector emissions.
100\% annual renewable matching policy can also deliver system-level \co emissions reductions (left bar in \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-zone_emissions}); however, beyond 85\% CFE target, 24/7 hourly matching achieves greater emissions reductions than 100\% annual mathing policy.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plots/10/2025/IE/p1/zone_emissions.pdf}
    \caption{\co emissions in the local region (Ireland).}
    \label{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-zone_emissions}
\end{figure}

The following analysis reveals the \gls{cfe} procurement strategies by participating consumers for each procurement policy.
\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-ci_capacity} shows that for 10\% of \gls{ci} load in Ireland (220 MW), the 100\% RES policy is cost-optimally met with 1.3~GW of onshore wind and solar generators.
Matching demand with clean generation on 24/7 hourly basis requires a much bigger portfolio of wind and solar than the 100\% RES policy.
Also, for CFE target above 85\% the cost-optimal procurement sees battery storage enter the portfolio mix.
Note that for 80\% CFE target, 24/7 participating consumers procure less capacity than for 100\% annual matching policy, as it relies more on grid imports.

The breakdown of costs associated with a procurement policy that participating consumers choose is shown in \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p1-ci_costandrev}.
Note that revenues from selling the excess electricity to the regional grid at market prices can be treated as ”negative costs” and subtracted from the net procurement cost.
The results show that a CFE targets of 80\%--95\% can be achieved at a small cost premium to 100\% annual renewable matching with solar, wind and batteries.
However, what stands out in the plot is the rapid increase of procurement costs for high 24/7 CFE targets. 
For example, 98\% CFE target has cost premium of 54\% over 100\% the RES policy; while the last 2\% of hourly CFE matching more than doubles the costs.

\subsection{Technology access}
\label{subsec:palette}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{res}
    24/7 CFE procurement triggers investment in new technologies the system will need later: long-duration storage and advanced clean firm generators.
\end{res}

\vspace*{5pt}
\begin{res}
    High targets for 24/7 CFE procurement could have a much smaller cost premium if long duration energy storage or advanced clean firm technologies are available for a commercial scale up.
\end{res}

The cost premium of 24/7 hourly clean electricity procurement presented in \cref{subsec:base} is driven by the variability of renewable power supply.
Indeed, in the periods when not much wind or solar is available, matching every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption with carbon-free electricity on hourly basis is not an easy task.
Battery storage technology is cost-optimal for shifting surplus a power supply by a couple of hours. 
However, bridging extended periods of low wind and sun with battery storage is expensive.
Results above also illustrate that for CFE targets of 98\%--100\%, 24/7 participating consumers rely little on the grid supply, since electricity mix in the local grids contain some carbon content.

The results in \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p23-ci_procurement} reflect a case when 24/7~CFE participants have an access to a wider palette of technologies: 
long-duration energy storage (\gls{ldes}) and advanced clean firm generators, such as advanced geothermal systems, advanced nuclear or Allam cycle generators with carbon capture and sequestration.

The top row shows the power capacity portfolio (\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p2-ci_capacity}) and the breakdown of costs (\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p2-ci_costandrev}) for a case when \gls{ci} consumers have an access to \textbf{palette~2} technologies, i.e., the \gls{ldes} system is also available on a market.%
\footnote{Here we assume 2.5~\euro/kWh underground hydrogen storage in salt caverns.}
The \gls{ldes} helps to align the load with the generation of procured variable renewable resources. 
As a result, the cost-optimal portfolio of renewable capacity for the 100\% 24/7 CFE target is not much larger than for the 100\% annual matching policy. 
This also significantly decreases procurement costs at high CFE targets: 100\% 24/7~CFE has a cost premium of 42\% above 100\% annual renewable mathing policy.

The bottom row shows the results for technological \textbf{palette 3} scenario (\cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p3-ci_capacity} and \cref{fig:10-2025-IE-p3-ci_costandrev}). 
The procurement strategy now includes the Allam cycle generator.
The clean firm technology can be operated any time of the year and thus helps to fill in the gaps in variable renewable generation to match demand and clean generation on hourly basis.
Inclusion of clean firm generation also reduces renewable capacity and storage requirements. 
This, in turn, further limits the 24/7 CFE cost premium.
In this scenario, 100\% 24/7~CFE costs only 15\% above 100\% annual renewable mathing.

\subsection{Diverse grid locations}
\label{subsec:location}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{res}
    Each region of the European electricity system has unique characteristics, such as renewable resources, national policies, degree of interconnection, etc.
    Despite these differences, the model results for 24/7 clean energy procurement show similar trends. 
\end{res}

While we have focused on base scenario reflecting the case of Ireland, exactly the same modelling exercise can be repeated for other regions of the European electricity grid.
Since each region has a unique set of characteristics that depend on local resources, renewable potentials, national energy and climate policies, and degree of interconnections, such sensitivity can allow for generalising the impact of 24/7 CFE procurement void regional differences.

\cref{fig:10-2025-DEPL-p3-4plots} shows results for the two selected regions: Germany and Poland. Germany is selected as it the largest electricity consumer in Europe and it is well interconnected to regions with clean electrcity grids, such as France and Denmark. 
Poland -- a country with  historic dependency on domestic coal resources, resistance from the coal industry and lack of governmental support for renewable energy -- is selected for a contrast. To keep other factors constant, the same 10\% share of \gls{ci} consumers is set to participate in voluntary clean electricity procurement.%
\footnote{10\% participation rate of \gls{ci} sector yields load of 3.8~GW in Germany and 1.1~GW in Poland.}

Despite regional differences, the dynamics of 24/7 CFE procurement, observed in the example of Ireland, show similar trends. 

As can be expected, the cleaner grid in the German case results in a lower value of the average emissions rate of participating consumers than in the case of Poland. 
The values in the reference case are at 240~g\co/kWh and 549~g\co/kWh for Germany and Poland, respectively.%
\footnote{For reference, 2021 estimates for emission intensity of electricity generation are 402~g\co/kWh in Germany and 750~g\co/kWh Poland \cite{EEA-europa-web}.}
Similar to the Irish results, \cref{fig:10-2025-DE-p3-ci_emisrate} and \cref{fig:10-2025-PL-p3-ci_emisrate} show that in both cases, \gls{ci} participants achieve lower emissions rates with 24/7 hourly CFE procurement than with 100\% annual matching once CFE target is tight enough. 
As expected at 100\% CFE target, participating consumers achieve a zero emission rate associated to their electricity consumption, since they perfectly match demand and clean generation on hourly basis.

A result that stands out in the cases of Germany and Poland is the impact of the 24/7 hourly CFE procurement on the system-level \co emissions, as shown in \cref{fig:10-2025-DE-p3-zone_emissions} and \cref{fig:10-2025-PL-p3-zone_emissions}.
Without any CFE procurement stategy, the German and Polish power sector carbon emissions are at 118.8~Mt\co and 83.8~Mt\co in 2025, respectively.%
\footnote{Germany is a larger electricity consumer, while Polish electricity mix has much a higher emission intensity; thus, power sector carbon emissions are on a similar scale for these regions.} 
If only 10\% of C\&I load joins efforts of voluntary \gls{cfe} procurement, a significant decarbonisation impact is achieved. 
For example in Germany, with this participation, the 100\% annual matching with renewable electricity can reduce system-level \co emissions by 11.1~Mt\co per year. 
With the 24/7 hourly matching, C\&I consumers achieve even greater impact on emissions, up to 14~Mt\co per year with CFE 100\% target.

\cref{fig:10-2025-DE-p3-ci_costandrev} and \cref{fig:10-2025-PL-p3-ci_costandrev} also show similar trends to the base scenario. 
For lower CFE targets, participating consumers can complement portfolio with electricity imports from grid. To achieve higher CFE targets, an clean firm generatorion is added to the portfolio, which greatly reduces the need for renewable generation capacity to match load on an hourly basis. 
In the case of Germany and Poland, both the Allam cycle generator with CCS and advanced dispatchable generator enter the optimal procurement strategy. 
This is likely due to a case that these regions are better interconnected with the rest of the European electrcity grid than Ireland. 
A better interconnection makes possible to exhaust all arbitrage opportunities across time and space and maximise the dispatch value from an advanced dispatchable generator with low variable costs.

\subsection{Moving five years more ahead}
\label{subsec:time}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{res}
    In 2030, participating consumers benefit from decreasing costs of clean technologies and cleaner state of the electricity grids.
\end{res}

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{res}
    Voluntary commitments to clean electricity procurement bring system value even in
    cleaner grids. Similarly to the base scenario, 24/7 hourly matching results in deeper decarbonisation than 100\% annual renewable matching if CFE targets are above certain treshhold.
\end{res}

In the scenarios above, we have been exploring 24/7 clean electricity procurement within the European electricity system, with a focus on the year 2025. 
In this section, we shift our attention to the results and implications of these procurement strategies for the year 2030. 
This will provide a deeper understanding of the long-term effects and the potential evolution of clean energy procurement across Europe, as companies continue to adapt their procurement strategies to achieve carbon-free energy goals.

From the modelling perspective, many system parameters change with a five year step to 2030. 
In particular, the technology costs decline due to economics of scale and incremental innovation, national energy- and climate policies become more tight, and some legacy power plants leave the market. 
An overarching feature of the five-year step is a cleaner state of the electricity grids.

\cref{fig:10-2030-IE-6plots} illustrates the results for the "base scenario" moved five years into the future to 2030, with all other factors held constant. 

\cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-used} shows the fraction of hourly demand met with clean electricity for each procurement policy -- now in 2030. 
There two observations from comparing these results with a base scenario.
First, in the reference case, 72\% of demand is met with CFE, which is 18\% more than in 2025, which is a result of a cleaner electricity grid on a background. 
Thus, lower CFE targets (such as 80\%) are met with a larger share of grid imports. 
Second, higher CFE targets still require a independency from grid imports for the perfect match of clean electricity with \gls{ci} load on hourly basis. 
At 100\% 24/7 CFE, participating consumers rely only on procured resources.

The average emissions rate of 24/7 participating consumers is intuitively lower with a cleaner regional network. 
As shown in \cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-ci_emisrate}, the reference case value is reduced from 240~g\co/kWh in 2025 to 107~g\co/kWh in 2030.
The dynamics of 24/7 CFE procurement remains also in 2030. An hourly 24/7 matching allows for net-zero emissions associated with the \gls{ci} buyers' consumption, with a lower emission rate than 100\% annual matching already at 90\% CFE target.
An interesting result is that a CFE target of 90\% yields lower \gls{ci} emission rate, although costs the same as the 100\% annual matching for all three technological palettes (see \cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-ci_costandrev}--\cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-ci_costandrev}). 

\cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-zone_emissions} show that both 100\% annual matching with renewable energy and the 24/7 hourly matching with \gls{cfe} keep positive effect on system-level emissions even in cleaner system. 
Similarly to 2025, if CFE target is high enough, a diverse resource portfolio procured by 24/7 participating consumers has a larger impact on net system emissions in a local zone than 100\% annual matching.
Interestingly, in the case of 2030, 100\% 24/7 CFE nearly doubles the decarbonisation effect of 100\% annual matching: 100\% RES reduces emissions in the local zone by 0.2~Mt\co/a (8\% of Irish power section emissions), while 100\% 24/7 CFE yields reduction of 0.4~Mt\co/a. The nature of this effect is explained in \cref{subsec:mechanisms}.

The \gls{ci} cost breakdown for Ireland 2030 scenario shows that net costs for 24/7 CFE matching fall for all technological palettes. Participating consumers benefit from decreasing costs of clean technologies and cleaner state of the electricity grids.
\cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p2-ci_costandrev} and \cref{fig:10-2030-IE-p1-ci_costandrev} show that in 2030, cost-optimal portfolio mix procured by the \gls{ci} participants for CFE 100\% target has a very limited cost premium to 100\% annual renewable matching with LDES and clean firm technologies. 
At the same time, participanting consumers achieve a zero emission rate associated to their electricity consumption and have a bigger impact on \co emissions in the rest of the system.
